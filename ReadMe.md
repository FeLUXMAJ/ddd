==========

You will want to look at the structure of the `convert.pl` script.
It consists of helper functions that create fragments of JSON for various paragraph types.
It includes a scanner that reads one specific document.
This will only suggest how you might crack the style codes used should you have a similar need.

=========

We're promoting Eric Evans' Domain Driven Design by creating a new wiki about his book.
Federation, enabled by CC licensing, was the missing element of the first pattern wiki.
