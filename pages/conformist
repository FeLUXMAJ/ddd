      "text": "When two development teams have an upstream/downstream relationship in which the upstream has no motivation to provide for the downstream team's needs, the downstream team is helpless. Altruism may motivate upstream developers to make promises, but they are unlikely to be fulfilled. Belief in those good intentions leads the downstream team to make plans based on features that will never be available. The downstream project will be delayed until the team ultimately learns to live with what it is given. An interface tailored to the needs of the downstream team is not in the cards."

Although this cramps the style of the downstream designers and probably does not yield the ideal model for the application, choosing conformity enormously simplifies integration. Also, you will share a ubiquitous language with your supplier team. The supplier is in the driver's seat, so it is good to make communication easy for them. Altruism may be sufficient to get them to share information with you."
