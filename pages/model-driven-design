At the same time, complex mappings between models and design functions are difficult to understand and, in practice, impossible to maintain as the design changes. A deadly divide opens between analysis and design so that insight gained in each of those activities does not feed into the other."

Demand a single model that serves both purposes well, in addition to supporting a fluent [[ubiquitous language]]."
